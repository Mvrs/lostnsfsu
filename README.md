## Acknowledgement

This goal with this project is to get myself more comfortable with React and more confident in building full stack web applications. To also note: My cloud hosting for production will be Digital Ocean, just timing my decision for hosting my database as the costs is much higher than hosting a domain. My Domain is online and secure but the current build thats up wont be easy on the eyes.

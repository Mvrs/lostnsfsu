  Replacement For On Campus Housing
</h2>

A full stack React application to connect my local university with home owners and landlords to lease their space to students who've ran out of options

## What's the Problem?

I've known many friends who applied to on-campus housing and either had to wait for a space to open or was placed in a queue for the following semester. Not only can this effect the students mental state but I've had friends semesters take a turn in the wrong direction because they've had to find housing the university did not support in aid.

## What's the Solution?

1. Allow my local university to add more space for funding to support off-campus housing.
2. This gives students the opportunity to practicely live in the downtown area **or what area they choose** and still receive the same benefits that students on-campus would receive.
3. Home owners or landlords would recieve bonus tax incentives for supporting the local university
4. This not only gives students slight priority but also allow those who're leasing the property to build a foundation of trust.

## Thoughts on the development process

> _For Frontend_

Currently, I'm using **React** and **TypeScript** for a clean architecture pattern. This allows me to enforce static typing and enforce good coding habits. When it comes to the design process I'm leaning towards **styled-components** since I can reduce the number of css files plus `styled-components` have seen an increased performance boost since **v4**.

I'm a UI/UX guy at heart so for testing my UI Components i'll try my luck with **Storybook** since I can make sure I live by `a11y` standards ðŸ™ƒ

> _For Backend_

I went with **Postgres** and the **Knex.js** libraray for building quickly buildiing SQL queries. It's good _for now_ until the project becomes more complex and the need for **Objection.js** with TypeScript support brings smiles to your face.

> _For Testing_

Not very family with testing **still learning** but i'll be leaning towards TDD with [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library) and **Jest**.
